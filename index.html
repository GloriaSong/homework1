    <li>Introduction of the graphics you choose</li>
      <p> This graphic shows the three biggest future changes in the workplace according to a survey conducted by Human Resources professionals. This graphics shows three aspects as follows.</p>
   
    
    <li>Why is this visualisation problematic/ confusing/ misleading?</li>
      <p> The three aspects in this pie chart cannot be sum
        <p>Also, the graphics does not show what does the percentage mean. Is it the proportion of people that agrees with the following statement?</p>
   
    <li>Further illustrations and calculations, if any, to justify your point, your suggestions or thoughts to improve</li>
      <p> From my point of view, a bar chart is better in illustrating the content instead of the pie chart. We can also list the three aspect from the high support rate to low support rate.</p> 
    <li>Reference pointers, e.g. source link, reference book/ article</li>
